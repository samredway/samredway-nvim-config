# My Nvim Config

Just my nvim config. I keep it here because its handy to be able to pull it onto multiple devices.

This is a super simple setup primarily for use as a backend python developer. I use pylsp, flake8 and mypy for respectively for code completion, linting and static analysis. I also have a language server support for other langauges notably Js and Typescript which I use at work as well as Rust, C++, C which I play with from time to time at home.

If you stumble across this and want to use it or just check or copy something from my config feel free. I think the way I have mypy setup using [guard](https://github.com/nvimdev/guard.nvim), for example, is probably the best/easiest way to do this.

I gained original inspiration for the excellent [Kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) project, so you should probably check that out if you want a minimal setup from scratch with plenty of instructions.
