# My Nvim Config

Just my nvim config. I keep it here because its handy to be able to pull it onto multiple devices (I work on mac though so dont know if it works well on other setups).

This is a simple setup which I use daily as a software engineer working with primarily Python (for which I use pyright, flake8 and mypy respectively for code completion, linting and static analysis) but also Js and Typescript, C++, and Golang.

If you stumble across this and want to use it or just check or copy something from my config feel free. I think the way I have mypy setup using [Guard](https://github.com/nvimdev/guard.nvim), for example, is probably the best/easiest way to do this.

I gained original inspiration for the excellent [Kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) project, so you should probably check that out if you want a minimal setup from scratch with plenty of instructions including how to setup the base dependencies - notable Lazy.nvim
